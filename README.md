# Quantum Computing Simulations

A comprehensive repository of algorithms and simulations based on Q#, PyQuil, and Qiskit for quantum computing.

![](https://github.com/sabneet95/Quantum-Computing/blob/master/bloch_anim.gif)

â†’ `The repository provides a foundation for developing and testing quantum computing algorithms. The code can be easily customized to accommodate complex and unique algorithms in the future.`

## Requirements

The following software development kits (SDKs) are required to run the simulations:

1. [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit)

2. [Rigetti Forest SDK](https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/start.html)

3. [IBM Qiskit SDK](https://qiskit.org/)



## Build and Environment Information

The simulations have been tested using Visual Studio Code with the following environment setup:

* Visual Studio Code Version: 1.52.1
* Commit: ea3859d4ba2f3e577a159bc91e3074c5d85c0523
* Electron Version: 9.3.5
* Chrome Version: 83.0.4103.122
* Node.js Version: 12.14.1
* V8 Version: 8.3.110.13-electron.0
* Operating System: Windows_NT x64 10.0.19042
* Memory: 1981M
* Cores: 8

## Usage

1)	Open the project in **Visual Studio Code** > and install any required extensions

2)  For instance, _run_ the C# driver code to simulate a hydrogen atom as:

```C#
using System;
using Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.Core;
using Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.Simulators;

namespace Quantum.Hydrogen
{
    class Driver
    .
        ..
            ...
```
3) Customize and run the simulations as desired.
